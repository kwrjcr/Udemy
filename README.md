# Udemy Course: The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications
> This was a course I started taking on Udemy and I am slowly making my way through it.  As the title says it is a course to help you build 10 real world applications.  Even though I know python there are still things I can learn and techniques with which I am unfamiliar with.  So far this project has helped fill in some gaps for me.  

## Installation
> This project is full of different projects I have learned throughout this course.  In order to complete them you will need to install a few different python packages. python 3.5+, numpy, pandas, scipy, flask (python web framework).  Just to name a few of them.  I am still working my way through the course, so I will inevitably have to install more packages.
